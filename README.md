### 4. change the interests value to any word that you'd like.
### 5. change the ignore value to any word that you'd like
### 6. be sure to insert phone number in the right place
### 7. run the cells.
### 8. a tab of whatsapp web should be opened by now, if the message wasn't sent but exists, send it.


#### 9. optional: once you open the csv file, I recommend to remove duplicates of the info column and filter according to the newest date.
